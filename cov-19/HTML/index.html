                <h3>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
                    coronavirus..</h3>

                <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
                    recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical
                    problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more
                    likely to develop serious illness.

                </p>

                <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They get their
                    name, “corona,” from the many crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute
                    respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are
                    examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.

                    The new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The
                    virus has since spread to all continents (except Antarctica).
                </p>

                <img src="../Image/transmission.png" class="inline-photo1 show-on-scroll">
                <h3>How does the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from person to person?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When the virus travels in respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks,
                        sings or breathes near you (within six feet). This is thought to be the main way COVID-19 is
                        spread.</li>
                    <li>When the virus travels in small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for minutes to hours
                        from an infected person who is more than six feet away or has since left the space. This method
                        of spread is more likely to occur in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.</li>
                    <li>From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.</li>
                    <li>By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose
                        before washing your hands. (Not thought to spread easily by this method.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or
                    from transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). The virus travels to the back of your
                    nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to
                    multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.

                    Governments, health agencies, researchers and healthcare providers are all working together to
                    develop policies and procedures to limit the spread of this virus both globally and from individual
                    to individual.</p>

                <h3><strong>Right now, the best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow some of the same steps
                        you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu..</strong>
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds— especially before eating and preparing food, after
                        using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a
                        cold.
                    <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.
                    <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your
                        sleeve. Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into
                        your hands!
                    <li>Avoid close contact (within six feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home
                        if you are sick.
                    <li>If you are prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of
                        people. Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities especially during outbreaks.
                    <li>Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and counter tops) with a virus-killing
                        disinfectant.
                    <li>Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
                    <li>Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.
                    <li>Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able.
                        These steps will strengthen your immune system and enable you to fight off infections easier.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../Image/prevention.jpg" class="inline-photo1 show-on-scroll">
                <h3>Face mask Is it Necessary ?</h3>
                <img src="../Image/facemask.jpg" class="inline-photo1 show-on-scroll">
                <p>The WHO recommends wearing a cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it’s hard to
                    maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and another person. Face masks protect both
                    you and the people around you. Cloth face masks are being recommended because we now know
                    individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others.

                    The cloth face coverings recommended by the WHO are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which
                    should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.

                    usually milder, symptoms than adults. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical
                    conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk of more serious complication
                    from COVID-19.

                <h3><strong>How is coronavirus diagnosed?</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>COVID-19 is diagnosed with a laboratory test. Your healthcare provider may collect a sample of your
                    saliva or swab your nose or throat to send for testing.</p>
                <h3><strong>When should I be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19)?</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>Call your healthcare provider if you

                    -Feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing.
                    -Have been in close contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
                    Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms. Your healthcare provider will
                    tell you if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 and where to go to be tested.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>If I have a positive test for coronavirus, how long should I self-isolate?</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>According to current WHO recommendations, you should self-isolate until you've met all three of the
                    following criteria:</p>
                <li>
                    <ul>It's been 10 days since your symptoms first appeared.</ul>
                    <ul>You've not had a fever for 24 hours and you've not used fever-lowing medications during this
                        time.</ul>
                    <ul>Your COVID-19 symptoms have improved.</ul>
                </li>
                <p>
                    While at home, ideally self-isolate within separate room of your home if possible to limit
                    interaction with other family members. If you can’t stay 100% isolated in a separate room, stay six
                    feet away from others and wear a cloth mask, wash your hands often/family members wash hands often,
                    and frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces and shared areas.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You don't need to be retested to be around others outside your home. However, since everyone and
                    every
                    case is unique, follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a weakened immune system or have had a severe case of COVID-19, the CDC's criteria do
                    not
                    apply to you. You may need to stay home for up to 20 days after your symptoms first appeared. Talk
                    with
                    your healthcare provider about your situation.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>How long do I need to isolate myself if I’ve been around a person with COVID-19?</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>According to the WHO, if you’ve been in close contact with a person who has COVID-19, your safest
                    strategy is to stay home for 14 days after you’ve last seen this person.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Is it possible to test negative for COVID-19 and still be infected with the virus?</strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. This is possible. There are several reasons for “false negative” test results -- meaning you
                    really
                    DO have COVID-19 although the test result says you don’t.

                    Reasons for a false negative COVID-19 test result include:
                </p>
                <li>
                    <ul> You were tested too early in the course of illness. The virus hasn’t multiplied in your body to
                        the
                        level that it could be detected by the test.</ul>
                    <ul>A good specimen was not obtained. The healthcare personnel may not have swabbed deeply enough in
                        the
                        nasal cavity to collect a good sample. There could also be handling errors and transportation
                        errors, as
                        the sample must be transported to a lab to be tested.</ul>
                    <ul>The COVID-19 test itself was not sensitive or specific enough to detect COVID-19. “Sensitivity”
                        refers
                        to the ability of the test to detect the smallest amount of virus. “Specificity” refers to the
                        ability
                        of the test to detect only the COVID-19 virus and not other similar viruses. Many different
                        commercial
                        and hospital laboratories have developed tests for COVID-19. All must meet standards, but no
                        test is
                        100% sensitive and 100% specific for COVID-19. This is why there is always a possibility of
                        “false
                        negative” and “false positive” tests.</ul>
                </li>
                <p>
                    If you think you might have COVID-19 even if your test is negative, it’s best to follow the current
                    CDC
                    recommendation. Stay home for 10 days if you think you are sick. Stay six feet away from others
                    (“social
                    distancing”) and wear a cloth mask. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen.
                    Contact
                    your healthcare provider when your symptoms improve – don’t decide on your own if it’s safe for you
                    to
                    be around others.

                <h3><strong>What medications are currently approved to treat COVID-19?</strong>
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Currently, only one drug has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Remdesivir
                    (Veklury®) is approved to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.
                </p>
                <h3>What treatments do people receive if they have COVID-19?</h3>
                <p>One authoritative organization – The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines
                    Panel – recommends the following treatments based on the severity of COVID-19.
                </p>
                <h3><strong>If you’re not in the hospital or don’t need supplemental oxygen</strong></h3>
                <h3><strong>If you’re in the hospital:</strong></h3>
                <li>
                    <ul>You may be given IV remdesivir with or without the oral (by mouth) corticosteroid dexamethasone
                        (or other steroid) or dexamethasone alone if remdesivir can’t be used.</ul>
                    <ul>Depending on the severity of your COVID infection, you may need:
                        <ul>Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils).</ul>
                        <ul>Mechanical ventilation (receive oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea). You are
                            given medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen
                            through a ventilator.</ul>
                        <ul>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). You continue to receive treatment while a
                            machine pumps your blood outside your body. It takes over the function of your body’s lungs
                            and heart.</ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h3>What vaccines are in use or in late-stage development to prevent COVID-19?</h3>
                <p>The Food and Drug Administration has granted Emergency Use Authorization for three coronavirus
                    vaccines. The companies manufacturing the vaccines are Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/NIH and Johnson &
                    Johnson. Initial doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were distributed in the United States (and
                    worldwide) beginning in December 2020. In April of 2021, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration
                    recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Six women in the U.S. developed
                    blood clots after receiving this company's vaccine. The agencies want to investigate any possible
                    link between the vaccine and clots and determine if indications of who should receive this vaccine
                    need to be changed. The 10-day pause was lifted in late April and distribution of the vaccine
                    resumed without restrictions.

                    The Pfizer vaccine is administered as two doses, 21 days apart and is authorized for use in those
                    age 12 and older. The Moderna vaccine is administered as two doses, 28 days apart and is authorized
                    for use in those age 18 and older. Both vaccines have shown similar efficacy levels of near 95%.

                    Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is a single dose vaccine authorized for use in individuals 18 years of
                    age and older. Results of a 44,000-person global clinical trial showed the vaccine to be 67%
                    effective against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 at 14 days after being vaccinated and 66% effective at
                    28 days after vaccination. Against severe COVID-19, the vaccine was found to be 77% effective at 14
                    days after vaccination and 85% at 28 days after vaccination.

                    More than 50 vaccines continued to being studied to prevent COVID-19. They are now in late-stage
                    (phase three) development and enrolling participants in the United States. Information on some of
                    these vaccines includes:
                </p>
                <li>
                    <ul>AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are testing their two-dose vaccine in 30,000 trial
                        enrollees. They are reporting that their vaccine is up to 90% effective.</ul>
                    <ul>Novavax has a two-dose vaccine being tested in a trial enrolling 40,000 people.</ul>
                </li>
                <h3>If I’ve tested positive for COVID-19 and do not need hospitalization, what can I do to best
                    manage my symptoms at home?</h3>
                <p>If you have mild COVID-19 symptoms, you will likely need to manage your health at home. Follow these
                    tips:</p>
                <li>
                    <ul>If you have a fever, drink plenty of fluids (water is best), get lots of rest, take
                        acetaminophen (Tylenol®).</ul>

                    <ul>If you have a cough, lie on your side or sit up (don’t lie on your back). Add a teaspoon of
                        honey to your hot tea or hot water (don’t give honey to children under one year old). Gargle
                        with salt water. Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about over-the-counter,
                        comfort care product, like cough suppressants, cough drops/lozenges. Have a friend or family
                        member pick up any needed medicines. You must stay at home.</ul>
                    <ul>If you are anxious about your breathing, try to relax. Take slow deep breaths in through your
                        nose and slowly release through pursed lips (like you’re are slowly blowing out a candle). If
                        you are having trouble breathing, call 911.</ul>
                    <p>If you have a mild case of COVID-19, you should start to feel better in a few days to a week. If
                        you think your symptoms are getting worse, call your healthcare provider.</p>
